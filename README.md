# ☁️ Cloud-Based Data Analytics and Automation Pipeline  
### End-to-End Serverless Analytics using Amazon S3, Athena, QuickSight, Glue & Redshift Spectrum  

## 📘 Overview  
The **Cloud-Based Data Analytics and Automation Pipeline** project demonstrates how to build a **serverless and scalable data analytics solution** using **AWS cloud services**.  
The system automates data ingestion, transformation, and visualization workflows — enabling organizations to perform large-scale data analysis without managing any servers.  

This project leverages the **New York City Taxi Trip Records dataset**, providing real-world insights into taxi operations, fare patterns, and trip behaviors using interactive dashboards and automated ETL pipelines.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview  
The architecture is built entirely using **serverless AWS components** for flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency:

1. **Amazon S3** – Acts as a central data lake for raw and processed data.  
2. **AWS Glue** – Crawls and catalogs the dataset for schema discovery and performs ETL transformations.  
3. **Amazon Athena** – Executes SQL-based queries directly on S3 data using a schema-on-read approach.  
4. **Amazon QuickSight** – Visualizes analytics results through dynamic dashboards and reports.  
5. **Amazon Redshift Spectrum (Optional)** – Enables federated querying on S3 data for hybrid analytics.

## 🗂️ Dataset Details  
**Dataset:** NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Records  
**Duration:** 2009–2016  
**Source:** [AWS Public Datasets](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/)  

Each record includes:  
- Pickup/Drop-off locations and times  
- Trip distance  
- Fare amount and payment type  
- Passenger count  
- Tip and tax details  

Data is stored in **CSV** and converted into **Apache Parquet** format for optimized querying.

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps  

### **1️⃣ Data Ingestion & Storage**
- Collected and stored raw NYC Taxi data in **Amazon S3**.  
- Organized datasets into partitions for improved query performance.  

### **2️⃣ Data Transformation & Cataloging**
- Created an **AWS Glue Crawler** to detect schema and populate the **Glue Data Catalog**.  
- Built **PySpark-based ETL jobs** in AWS Glue to clean, filter, and convert CSV data to Parquet.  

### **3️⃣ Serverless Querying with Athena**
- Defined external tables in Athena using Hive DDL syntax.  
- Executed SQL queries directly on data stored in S3.  
- Compared performance between CSV and Parquet file formats.  

### **4️⃣ Data Visualization with QuickSight**
- Connected QuickSight to Athena datasets.  
- Created **interactive dashboards** showing trip frequency, fare averages, and hourly patterns.  
- Delivered real-time KPIs for decision-making.  

### **5️⃣ Redshift Spectrum Integration (Optional)**
- Linked Amazon Redshift with S3 data using Spectrum for hybrid analysis.  
- Demonstrated cost-optimized querying with high scalability.
